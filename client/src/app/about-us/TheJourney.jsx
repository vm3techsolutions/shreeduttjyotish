       Since childhood, I felt a deep fascination for the celestial patterns and the unseen energies that shape our lives. What began as curiosity 
soon evolved into a lifelong calling — to help people align their actions with the universe’s rhythm. Over the years, I immersed myself 
in the study of Vedic Astrology, Vastu Shastra, and Numerology, learning from masters and sacred texts.”“Today, my purpose is simple — to translate these cosmic insights into practical, positive, and transformative guidance for individuals, 
families, and businesses worldwide. </p>
